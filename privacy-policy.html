  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective date: May 13, 2025</p>

  <p>We at <strong>Online Fortune Telling</strong> value your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your personal information. The key point: we do not collect, store, or share any personal data from users of our app except when using third-party services as described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect any personal data such as names, email addresses, or other identifiable information from users. Our app does not track, collect, or share your personal details in any form.</p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our app uses third-party services, including GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology, to generate fortune-telling content (such as tarot readings, palmistry, astrology, etc.). These services may collect anonymized data for the purpose of improving their functionality and services.</p>
  
  <p>Specifically, we use GPT-powered API services to generate content for the app. These services do not collect or store personal data from users of our app.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no usage of your information other than to provide the functionality of the app.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not share or sell your personal data. We only use third-party services (such as GPT) to process the data required for content generation, but these services do not store or share personal information.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>As we do not collect personal data, we do not need to implement additional security measures to protect your personal information. However, the third-party services we use may have their own security measures in place, and you should refer to their respective privacy policies for more information.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we ever make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update this page and include the date of the revision.</p>
